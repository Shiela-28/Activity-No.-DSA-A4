//Identify and discuss the concept of the Hash Tables in DSA/JavaScript => 
(Specifics on: Concept, Hash Functions, Hash Sets, Hash Tables, Hash Maps)

-Hash tables are an important concept in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) used in storing and accessing data in a quick and effective way. 
In the field of JavaScript, the hash tables are known as objects literals that allow developers to access value using their keys. 
The Hash Table concept is based on the idea of ​​using a hash function to convert the keys to thoseindicates in an array. 
The hash function allows developers to quickly access the values ​​by converting the keys to the indicates where the values ​​are stored.
In this way, data access has become faster and effective compared to other data structures.
Hash sets are a type of hash tables containing unique keys only. This allows developers to store unique keys without similarities.
On the other hand, hash tables contain key-value pairs that allow developers to access value using their keys.
Hash maps are a type of hash tables containing key-value pairs with unique keys.

//Identify and discuss the concept of the Trees in DSA/JavaScript => (Specifics on: Types and Concepts, Tree Traversals, Structuring and Destructuring Concepts, and Use Cases)

-In the world of data structures and algorithms (DSA) and JavaScript, trees or trees are an important concept used to organize data and provide effective ways of accessing and manipulating information.
Trees are a type of data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
Each node can have one or more child nodes, which allows the formation of the hierarchy of information.
There are different types of trees that can be used in DSA and JavaScript.
The main types of trees are the binary tree, binary search tree, and N-Ary Tree. 
The binary tree is a type of tree where each node has no more than two child nodes. 
The binary search tree is a type of binary tree that complies with a specific order order, which enables rapid access to data. 
The N-Ary Tree is a tree that can have more than two child nodes in each node. 
In traverse or traveling trees, there are three main methods that can be used:
the ordered traversal, preorder traversal, and postor traversal.
In the ordered traversal, the nodes are rotated in the left-child-right order, whereas in preorder traversal, the nodes are rotated in the root-left-child-right order.
In postor traversal, the nodes are rotated in the left-right-root order.
Structure and destruction of trees are important concepts in DSA and JavaScript. 
The structure of the trees enables the development of the hierarchy of the information, while the destrucuring enables the access and manipulation of data within the tree.
By structuring and destroying trees, data is easier to manage and manipulate. 
There are various use cases where trees can be used in DSA and JavaScript.
One of the main use cases of trees is to implement data structures such as binary search tree and heap.
Trees are also used to implement algorithms such as Tree Traversal and Tree balancing. 
In general, trees are an important concept in DSA and JavaScript that enables effective organizing and accessing data.
